## Gust

Git is the most popular version control system in the world, and developers usually use GitHub or GitLab to host their codes. Most open source communities base on the services of GitHub to collaborate, track issues and share codes. GitHub's an excellent service to manage all things of open source projects, but it's centralized. GitHub has many ways to influence or limit open source communities. Although the developers have the copyright of the codes, they may not access their repositories. Gust wants to give the communities complete control of their assets. So Gust is a self-host service for Git, not rewriting Git with Rust. There are many challenges to implementing a service like Gust, particularly syncing the codes, PRs and Issues with GitHub or GitLab.

Gust aims to build a monolithic and decentralized version control service with Git protocol, which can manage and share codes with others. Some companies use mono-repo to host codes like Google, Facebook and Twitter. For open source communities, mono-repo has more benefits than distributed repositories, and all members focus on the main branch and release schedule, so Gust has only one repo.
