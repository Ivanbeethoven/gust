## Gust

Git is the most popular version control system in the world, and developers use GitHub or GitLab to host their codes usually. The most open source communities base on the services of GitHub to collaborate, track issues and share codes. GitHub's a great service to manage the codes of open source project, but it's a centralized and can be influences by other things.

Gust aims to build a monolithic and decentralized version control service with Git protocol, which can be used to manage codes and share with others. Gust will be easy deployed with container and Kubernetes in different cloud providers.
